## Project Overview

In this project, I will explore **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.

**EDA** is the process of investigating, summarizing, and visualizing a dataset to understand its main characteristics, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and test assumptions before applying formal statistical analysis.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rates.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
